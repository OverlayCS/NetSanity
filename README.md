## ðŸ§  How It Works

NetSanity uses a modular detection system:

- **Client Module:** Monitors unauthorized code injection, game speed hacks, movement anomalies, and file integrity.
- **Server Module:** Validates network packets, monitors behavior, and takes corrective actions (kick/ban/report).
- **Integration Layer:** Hooks into Photon Fusion, PlayFab, or your custom backend for full control.
